# Personas

A persona is a composite character created to represent a specific segment of users. Personas help team members understand and empathize with their users, their needs and goals—and thus create better products. Personas usually include a name, picture, user quotes and representative scenarios with a focus on the users’ goals, motivation, and behavior. Interviews and ethnographic studies often provide the raw research that’s shaped into a persona.
